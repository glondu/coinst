=========

* "arch: all" packages are not properly handled: we should allow them
  to become broken on all architectures but i386.

* on "break" architectures, we need to remove binary packages without
  corresponding source packages from the Heidi output
  (or do we have the right semantics for these architectures?)
  ===> we should just not check co-installability on break_arch ???
       (but not true for smooth upgrade...)

* Issue with --equivocal (not the same choices made in both cases...)
  We should probably start by checking just installability, and then
  refine with co-installability.
