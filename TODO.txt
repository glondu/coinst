- Focus
  ==> Work on the quotiented graph
  ==> Highlight the roots
  ==> Show exactly the selected subgraph
  ==> Generate all focus graphs (and show to which nodes they correspond)

- Reponse Sylvain
- Annonce Js_of_ocaml
- Viwever: key bindings + redraw optimizations + tooltips
- Graph creation: focus on a package
- Bug in Lwt_pool

- Fix bug in eliom client (unwrapping elements)
- Fix performance issue in Ocaml

=============================

- remove dep edges that can be rebuilt by transitive closure

- smarter way to remove conflicts at the initial stage
    exist d, forall p, p in d -> exist q, q ## p /\ f ==> q

- try to associate a set of package and virtual packages to each
  disjunctive depends and conflict cliques

- find a way to automatically remove uninteresting nodes
  ===> not part of a non-trivial conflict clique
       (or only conflicts with nodes with no other conflicts?)
       + no package depends on it
       (and does not depend on any package?)

- improve algorithm for finding cliques of conflicts

- generate directly a dot file with position informations

- remove some edges that can be obtained by transitivity
- investigate the edges that was not removed

====
- what can we say about updates: desemphasize edges that are unchanged
