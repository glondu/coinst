- Viwever: key bindings + redraw optimizations + tooltips
- Graph creation: focus on a package

- Fix bug in eliom client (unwrapping elements)
- Fix performance issue in Ocaml
- Fix bug in debcheck solver

=============================

- draw the graph around a given package
  follow depencies forward, then backwards on conflicts
  ===> quotient again!

- improve algorithm for finding cliques of conflicts

  ====> we want to cluster clique

- generate directly a dot file with position informations

- remove some edges that can be obtained by transitivity
- investigate the edges that was not removed

====
- what can we say about updates: desemphasize edges that are unchanged
