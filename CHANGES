===== 1.9 (2013-10-21) =====

* Addition of two new tools: coinst-upgrades and comigrate
* Improvements to coinst:
 - Automatically calls gzip or bzip2 to decompress files, when needed
 - Several files can now be provided on the command line
 - File digest fields in hdlist files sometimes contains meaningless
   data beside the MD5 digest; this could result in spurious conflicts,
   and this data is now properly ignored.

===== 1.01 (2011-09-19) =====

* Fixed '-explain' option
* Fixed to work with Mandriva 2011.0

===== 1.0 (2011-09-02) =====
