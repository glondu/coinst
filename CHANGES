===== 1.9.3 (2016-02-13) =====

* Show single-package hints when asked to (using --hints)
* Fix buffering bug when printing hints
* Fix space/tab issue in Makefile

===== 1.9.2 (2016-01-24) =====

* Add build targets for bytecode binaries
* Do not generate easy hints with one single package in comigrate
* Do not try to hint removal of binary packages in comigrate since
  britney doesn't know how to handle those. Only source removals
  are supported for now
* Avoid crashing when reading a verisoned Provides field. Support
  to fully handle versioned provides will come in a later version
* Build using -annot and -bin-annot by default
* Update list of architectures in comigrate: i386, amd64, arm64,
  armel, armhf, mips, mipsel, powerpc, ppc64el and s390x
* Build with -safe-string
* Stop using Format.bprintf
* Compiles with OCaml 4.02.3
* Use http://http.debian.net/debian as a default mirror
* Coinst: Print package version when printing final report

===== 1.9.1 (2014-01-17) =====

* Comigrate and coinst-upgrades can now be used to compute a detailed
  report of the package migration status (coinst.irill.org/report)
* Coinst now outputs all minimal non co-installable set of packages
* Added a JSON output to Coinst
* Adapted 'comigrate --update' to repository changes
* Compiles with OCaml 4.01
* Many other small bugs fixed

===== 1.9 (2013-10-21) =====

* Addition of two new tools: coinst-upgrades and comigrate
* Improvements to coinst:
 - Automatically calls gzip or bzip2 to decompress files, when needed
 - Several files can now be provided on the command line
 - File digest fields in hdlist files sometimes contains meaningless
   data beside the MD5 digest; this could result in spurious conflicts,
   and this data is now properly ignored.

===== 1.01 (2011-09-19) =====

* Fixed '-explain' option
* Fixed to work with Mandriva 2011.0

===== 1.0 (2011-09-02) =====
