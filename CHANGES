===== 1.9.1 (2014-01-17) =====

* Comigrate and coinst-upgrades can now be used to compute a detailed
  report of the package migration status (coinst.irill.org/report)
* Coinst now outputs all minimal non co-installable set of packages
* Added a JSON output to Coinst
* Adapted 'comigrate --update' to repository changes
* Compiles with OCaml 4.01
* Many other small bugs fixed

===== 1.9 (2013-10-21) =====

* Addition of two new tools: coinst-upgrades and comigrate
* Improvements to coinst:
 - Automatically calls gzip or bzip2 to decompress files, when needed
 - Several files can now be provided on the command line
 - File digest fields in hdlist files sometimes contains meaningless
   data beside the MD5 digest; this could result in spurious conflicts,
   and this data is now properly ignored.

===== 1.01 (2011-09-19) =====

* Fixed '-explain' option
* Fixed to work with Mandriva 2011.0

===== 1.0 (2011-09-02) =====
